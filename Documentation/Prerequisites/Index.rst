Prerequisites
=============

* One page tree per country ("country branch")
* Root of each country branch has the option "Use as Root Page" set
* Crosslinks between the country branches work. Perhaps you have to set `config.typolinkCheckRootline = 1` and `config.typolinkEnableLinksAcrossDomains = 1` in your typoscript setup.
